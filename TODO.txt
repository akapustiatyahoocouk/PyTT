========== IMMEDIATE PIPELINE =====c=================================
*   For SqlDatabase handle the exceptions raised by 
    rollback_transaction properly - chaining, not replacing, the
    exceptions that caused rollback attempts in their handlers.
*   Add context (right click) menu to awt TextField and other text
    entry fields, with Copy, Cut, Parse, etc. For disabled text
    entry widgets only Copy shall work.
*   Teach FileResourceBundle to handle excape sequences in string
    resources, such as '\t' and '\n'. The \ itself must then be
    represented as '\\' in a resource text file.
*   Retire LocaleProvider + make Locale.default an observable
    property (that generates a PropertyChangeEvent).
    DONE, but needs testing. Requires the "Options/Language"
    admin skin main frame item.
*   Locale.__str__ needs to use UtilResources for proper localisation.
*   In many places in code there is "pass". Check on these - usually
    they silence the exception handlers; at least print the 
    exceptions as a red flag for debug runs, and log them too for
    post-mortem analysis.
*   Make TextFields enbed StringVars bound to them and emit
    DocumentEvents (insert, delete, replace, change).
*   Change MenuItem's "label" property to "text".
*   Create a new ActionMenuItem(MenuItem) class, for Action-based
    MenuItems. They should REJECT attempts to set their propertes 
    directly.
*   Define class awt.GroupBox(tk.LabelFrame).

========== NEED TO DO EVENTUALLY ===================================
*   When importing a class/feature from a module in the same 
    package, use the "from .<module> import <feature>" form instead
    of the longer "from <fq module name> import <feature>" form.
    Make sure this happens throughout the code base.
*   Use menu item / action "description"s as tooltips for menu 
    items, button, etc.

========== NICE TO HAVE ============================================
