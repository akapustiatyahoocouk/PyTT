========== IMMEDIATE PIPELINE =====c=================================
*   In CreateWorkspaceDialog add a choice governed by two mutually
    exclusive RadioButtons - "use current crdentials" and "specify
    new credentials" for the adminostrator User/Account of a newly
    created workspace.
*   Change WorkspaceSettings to hane a static property
    last_used_workspace_address:WorkspaceAddress instead of two 
    separate properties last_used_workspace_type and 
    last_used_workspace_address
*   Change AdminSkinSettings to use a single property 
    main_frame_bounds: Rectangle instead of 4 deparate properties
    main_frame_x, main_frame_y, main_frame_width and 
    main_frame_height.
*   Retire LocaleProvider + make Locale.default an observable
    property (that generates a PropertyChangeEvent).
    DONE, but needs testing. Requires the "Options/Language"
    admin skin main frame item.
*   For SqlDatabase handle the exceptions raised by 
    rollback_transaction properly - chaining, not replacing, the
    exceptions that caused rollback attempts in their handlers.
*   Add context (right click) menu to awt TextField and other text
    entry fields, with Copy, Cut, Parse, etc. For disabled text
    entry widgets only Copy shall work.
*   Teach FileResourceBundle to handle excape sequences in string
    resources, such as '\t' and '\n'. The \ itself must then be
    represented as '\\' in a resource text file.
*   Locale.__str__ needs to use UtilResources for proper localisation.
*   In many places in code there is "pass". Check on these - usually
    they silence the exception handlers; at least print the 
    exceptions as a red flag for debug runs, and log them too for
    post-mortem analysis.
*   Make TextFields enbed StringVars bound to them and emit
    DocumentEvents (insert, delete, replace, change).
*   Change MenuItem's "label" property to "text".
*   Create a new ActionMenuItem(MenuItem) class, for Action-based
    MenuItems. They should REJECT attempts to set their propertes 
    directly.
*   Define class awt.GroupBox(tk.LabelFrame).

========== NEED TO DO EVENTUALLY ===================================
*   When importing a class/feature from a module in the same 
    package, use the "from .<module> import <feature>" form instead
    of the longer "from <fq module name> import <feature>" form.
    Make sure this happens throughout the code base.
*   Use menu item / action "description"s as tooltips for menu 
    items, button, etc.
*   Isolate tk/ttl within AWT.
    *   Only AWT modules should import tk/ttk; all other components
        shall happily do without.
    *   tk/ttk widget configuration (.configure, etc.) services
        shall be hidden behint AWT-level properties.
*   Define Color class in AWT, like java.awt.Color.
*   Define Point, Size and Rectangle classes in AWT to be "tuples"
    of 2, 2, and 4 ints respectively, and use them.

========== NICE TO HAVE ============================================
*   AWT compound controls (ListBox, ComboBox, TreeView, TabbedPane,
    etc.) should define classes for their contained items (e.g.
    ListBoxItem for ListBox, TreeNode for TreeView, TabPage for
    TabbedPane, etc.) and use them.
