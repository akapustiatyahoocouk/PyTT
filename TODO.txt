========== IMMEDIATE PIPELINE ======================================
*   Change MenuItem's "label" property to "text".
*   Create a new ActionMenuItem(MenuItem) class, for Action-based
    MenuItems. They should REJECT attempts to set their propertes directly.
*   Refreshable, with request_refresh, perform_refresh and refresh()
    callback, all done on thv EDT (a-la Jpx).

========== NEED TO DO VENTUALLY ====================================
*   When importing a class/feature from a module in the same package, 
    use the "from .<module> import <feature>" form instead of the longer 
    "from <fully qualified module name> import <feature>" form.
    Make sure this happens throughout the code base
