========== IMMEDIATE PIPELINE ======================================
*   Change MenuItem's "label" property to "text".
*   Create a new class Window(tk.Toplevel) and merge WindowMixin
    into it.
*   In the newly created class Window streamline the handling of 
    the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol via WINDOW_CLOSING/WINDOW_CLOSED 
    events. No "tk protocol" handling shall be visible outside AWT.
*   Create a new ActionMenuItem(MenuItem) class, for Action-based
    MenuItems. They should REJECT attempts to set their propertes 
    directly.
*   Rename awt..TopFrame to awt.Frame.
*   Define class awt.Panel(tk.Frame).
*   Define class awt.GroupBox(tk.LabelFrame).
*   Refreshable, with request_refresh, perform_refresh and refresh()
    callback, all done on the EDT (a-la Jpx).

========== NEED TO DO EVENTUALLY ===================================
*   When importing a class/feature from a module in the same 
    package, use the "from .<module> import <feature>" form instead
    of the longer "from <fq module name> import <feature>" form.
    Make sure this happens throughout the code base.
*   Use menu item / action "descriotion"s as tooltips for menu 
    items, button, etc.

========== NICE TO HAVE ============================================
