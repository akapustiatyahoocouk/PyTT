    <h1>Welcome to PyTT</h1>

    <p>
       PyTT (Python Time Tracker) is a tool that helps every software engineer to 
       keep track of their activities during the week, the month,... always.</p>
    <p>
       Ever wondered how to file a "working hours" report at the end of the week? 
       How would you remember on Friday just how much time you've spent on that 
       pointless meeting on Monday?</p>
    <p>
       Have no fear, PyTT is here.</p>
    <p>
       With just one click PyTT will record the time and effort you've spent on any 
       given activity or task, providing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A minute-accurate report of your activities during the week.</li>
      <li>A live overview of your daily efforts and what they are contributing to.</li>
      <li>A guide on how to manage your time better.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just imagine a chess clock with multiple buttons - once you start working on 
    something, press the corresponding button; PyTT will do the rest.</p>
